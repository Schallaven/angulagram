# Quantitative characterization of molecular-stream separation



## Introduction

Molecular-stream separation (MSS), e.g. by free flow electrophoresis or continuous annular chromatography, has great potential for applications that require continuous downstream separation such continuous flow synthesis. In order to fully exploit this potential, tools for quantitative characterization of streams in MSS are required. 

We developed and introduce an analytical toolbox for this task (see [Kochmann et al.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02186)). The first tool is a method to convolute 3D raw MSS data into a 2D “angulagram” via signal integration over the whole separation zone using a polar coordinate system. The implementation of this tool is provided in this repository along with some sample data.

## Paper

The scripts and data were published in [Analytical Chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02186) as well as in [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Quantitative_Characterization_of_Molecular-Stream_Separation/6279296).

## Software

The software provided here include the Python (3.x) scripts to transform and convolute images into an angulagram as well as some sample data.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome!

While we are presenting here a working practical tool, we do not claim that our implementation of this tool is the best nor the only one. In fact, we foresee continuing development when other groups start adapting our approach.  Hereby, we explicitly invite the community to criticize, discuss, and further develop our angulagram approach and this tool.
